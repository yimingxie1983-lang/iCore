## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: DADA2 1.30+, cutadapt 4.4+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- R: `packageVersion('<pkg>')` then `?function_name` to verify parameters
- CLI: `<tool> --version` then `<tool> --help` to confirm flags

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# eDNA Metabarcoding

**"Process my eDNA samples to identify species"** → Transform raw amplicon reads (COI, 12S, rbcL, ITS) into species occurrence tables through primer removal, denoising (DADA2 ASVs), taxonomy assignment against reference databases (BOLD, MIDORI2), and contamination filtering with decontam.
- CLI: `cutadapt` for primer removal, `obi` (OBITools3) for paired-end assembly
- R: `dada2::filterAndTrim()` → `dada()` → `assignTaxonomy()` for ASV pipeline

Processes environmental DNA amplicon reads into species occurrence tables with taxonomy assignment, contamination filtering, and occupancy modeling.

## Primer Removal with Cutadapt

**Goal:** Remove amplicon primers from paired-end eDNA reads while discarding untrimmed read pairs.

**Approach:** Use cutadapt linked adapter trimming with marker-specific primer sequences and minimum overlap enforcement.

Linked adapter trimming removes primer pairs while discarding reads lacking primers:

```bash
# COI primers (mlCOIintF / jgHCO2198)
cutadapt -g 'GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC;min_overlap=20' \
         -G 'TAIACYTCIGGRTGICCRAARAAYCA;min_overlap=20' \
         --discard-untrimmed --pair-filter=any \
         -o trimmed_R1.fastq.gz -p trimmed_R2.fastq.gz \
         raw_R1.fastq.gz raw_R2.fastq.gz

# 12S MiFish-U primers
cutadapt -g 'GTCGGTAAAACTCGTGCCAGC;min_overlap=18' \
         -G 'CATAGTGGGGTATCTAATCCCAGTTTG;min_overlap=18' \
         --discard-untrimmed --pair-filter=any \
         -o trimmed_R1.fastq.gz -p trimmed_R2.fastq.gz \
         raw_R1.fastq.gz raw_R2.fastq.gz

# ITS primers (ITS1F / ITS2)
cutadapt -g 'CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA;min_overlap=18' \
         -G 'GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC;min_overlap=18' \
         --discard-untrimmed --pair-filter=any \
         -o trimmed_R1.fastq.gz -p trimmed_R2.fastq.gz \
         raw_R1.fastq.gz raw_R2.fastq.gz
```

## OBITools3 Pipeline

**Goal:** Process paired-end eDNA reads through the full OBITools3 workflow to produce a taxonomy-assigned species table.

**Approach:** Import reads, align pairs, filter by score/length, demultiplex, dereplicate, denoise with obi clean, assign taxonomy with ecotag, and export.

Full pipeline from paired-end reads to taxonomy table:

```bash
# Import paired FASTQ into OBITools3 DMS
obi import --fastq-input raw_R1.fastq.gz EDNA/reads1
obi import --fastq-input raw_R2.fastq.gz EDNA/reads2

# Paired-end alignment
obi alignpairedend -R EDNA/reads2 EDNA/reads1 EDNA/aligned

# Filter by alignment score and length
# score >= 50: removes poorly overlapping pairs
# length 100-500: typical COI amplicon range
obi grep -p 'sequence["score"] >= 50' EDNA/aligned EDNA/filtered
obi grep -p 'len(sequence) >= 100 and len(sequence) <= 500' \
    EDNA/filtered EDNA/length_filtered

# Demultiplex if needed (with ngsfilter file)
obi ngsfilter -t ngsfilter.txt -u EDNA/unassigned \
    EDNA/length_filtered EDNA/demux

# Dereplicate (obi uniq creates merged_sample attribute automatically)
obi uniq EDNA/demux EDNA/derep

# Remove singletons (count >= 2 removes PCR/sequencing errors)
obi grep -p 'sequence["count"] >= 2' EDNA/derep EDNA/no_singletons

# Denoise (remove PCR/sequencing errors)
# obi clean: denoises by merging low-abundance variants into parent sequences
# -s merged_sample: per-sample denoising (critical for multi-sample datasets)
# -r 0.05: ratio threshold; -H: keep only head sequences (discard variants)
obi clean -s merged_sample -r 0.05 -H EDNA/no_singletons EDNA/denoised

# Taxonomy assignment against reference database
obi ecotag -R EDNA/refdb --taxonomy EDNA/taxonomy EDNA/denoised EDNA/assigned

# Export to tab-separated format
obi export --tab-output EDNA/assigned > species_table.tsv
```

## DADA2 Pipeline for eDNA

**Goal:** Generate amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from eDNA reads with error correction and chimera removal.

**Approach:** Run the DADA2 workflow: filter/trim, learn error rates, denoise, merge pairs, remove chimeras, and assign taxonomy against a reference database.

DADA2 provides an alternative ASV-based approach:

```r
library(dada2)

# After cutadapt primer removal, get file paths
filt_fwd <- file.path('filtered', basename(fwd_reads))
filt_rev <- file.path('filtered', basename(rev_reads))

# Filter and trim
# maxEE=2: expected errors threshold balancing sensitivity/specificity
# truncLen: set based on quality profile inspection
out <- filterAndTrim(fwd_reads, filt_fwd, rev_reads, filt_rev,
                     maxN = 0, maxEE = c(2, 2), truncQ = 2,
                     minLen = 100, rm.phix = TRUE, multithread = TRUE)

# Learn error rates
err_fwd <- learnErrors(filt_fwd, multithread = TRUE)
err_rev <- learnErrors(filt_rev, multithread = TRUE)

# Denoise
dada_fwd <- dada(filt_fwd, err = err_fwd, multithread = TRUE)
dada_rev <- dada(filt_rev, err = err_rev, multithread = TRUE)

# Merge paired ends
# minOverlap=12: default; increase for short amplicons
merged <- mergePairs(dada_fwd, filt_fwd, dada_rev, filt_rev, minOverlap = 12)

# Build sequence table and remove chimeras
seqtab <- makeSequenceTable(merged)
# Chimera rate <20% is typical; >30% suggests library prep issues
seqtab_nochim <- removeBimeraDenovo(seqtab, method = 'consensus', multithread = TRUE)

# Taxonomy assignment against MIDORI2 or custom database
# minBoot=80: bootstrap confidence for genus-level; 50 for family
taxa <- assignTaxonomy(seqtab_nochim, 'MIDORI2_DADA2_COI.fasta.gz', minBoot = 80)
```

```

## Contamination Filtering

**Goal:** Identify and remove contaminant ASVs introduced during DNA extraction, PCR, or sequencing.

**Approach:** Apply decontam frequency/prevalence methods using negative controls and DNA concentrations, then remove tag-jumping artifacts with microDecon.

### decontam (frequency/prevalence method)

```r
library(decontam)

# Frequency method: uses DNA concentration from extraction blanks
contam_freq <- isContaminant(seqtab_nochim, conc = dna_concentration, method = 'frequency')

# Prevalence method: compares true samples vs negative controls
contam_prev <- isContaminant(seqtab_nochim, neg = is_negative_control, method = 'prevalence',
                             threshold = 0.5)
# threshold=0.5: ASV must be more prevalent in negatives than samples to flag

# Combined method
contam_both <- isContaminant(seqtab_nochim, conc = dna_concentration,
                             neg = is_negative_control, method = 'both')

seqtab_clean <- seqtab_nochim[, !contam_both$contaminant]
```

### microDecon for tag-jumping artifacts

```r
library(microDecon)

# Remove tag-jumping contamination between samples
# numb.blanks: number of blank/negative control columns at start of table
# numb.ind: vector of sample counts per group
decon_result <- decon(otu_table, numb.blanks = 3, numb.ind = c(10, 10, 10))
cleaned_table <- decon_result$decon.table
```

## Occupancy Modeling with occumb

**Goal:** Correct species occurrence estimates for imperfect detection across replicated eDNA samples.

**Approach:** Fit a multi-species occupancy model via MCMC (JAGS) on a 3D array of replicated read counts to estimate true occupancy probabilities.

Corrects for imperfect detection in metabarcoding replicates:

```r
library(occumb)

# Requires replicated eDNA samples (biological or PCR replicates)
# y: 3D array [species x sites x replicates] of read counts
data <- occumbData(y = count_array, spec_cov = species_covariates,
                   site_cov = site_covariates)

# Fit multi-species occupancy model (requires JAGS)
# n.chains=4, n.iter=10000: standard MCMC settings
fit <- occumb(data = data, n.chains = 4, n.iter = 10000, n.thin = 5, n.burn = 2500)

# Extract corrected occupancy estimates
summary(fit)
```

## Key Thresholds

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Min read depth per sample | 1,000 | Below this, rare species detection drops significantly |
| Singleton removal | count >= 2 | Singletons often represent sequencing errors |
| Chimera rate | <20% | Higher rates suggest library prep problems |
| COI species identity | >= 97% | Standard COI barcode gap threshold |
| COI genus identity | >= 95% | Conservative genus-level assignment |
| 12S species identity | >= 98% | 12S has less divergence than COI |
| decontam threshold | 0.5 | Balanced false positive/negative rate |
| DADA2 minBoot | 80 | Genus-level confidence; use 50 for family |
