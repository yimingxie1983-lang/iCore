## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: BioPython 1.83+, HyPhy 2.5+, PAML 4.10+, PRANK 170427+, scipy 1.12+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Positive Selection Analysis

**"Test my gene for positive selection"** → Detect adaptive evolution using dN/dS (omega) codon models including site models, branch models, and branch-site tests to identify positively selected sites.
- Python: PAML `codeml` for site and branch-site dN/dS tests
- CLI: `hyphy busted`, `hyphy meme` for HyPhy selection tests

## Critical Prerequisites

### Alignment Quality

PRANK is the recommended aligner for selection studies -- it correctly models insertions rather than forcing excess deletions (which create alignment artifacts that inflate dN/dS). Alternative: MACSE handles frameshifts and pseudogenes natively.

After alignment:
- Verify sequences are in-frame (length divisible by 3, no internal stop codons)
- Remove sequences with frameshifts or >50% gaps
- Use GUIDANCE or HoT to assess per-column alignment confidence
- Avoid block-filtering tools (Gblocks, trimAl) -- these frequently remove informative sites and can worsen downstream inference

### Recombination Screening

Run GARD (HyPhy) BEFORE any selection test. Recombinant sequences cannot be described by a single tree, and ignoring recombination inflates false positive rates for both PAML and HyPhy.

```bash
hyphy gard --alignment codon_alignment.fasta --output gard_results.json
```

If GARD detects breakpoints, partition the alignment at breakpoints and analyze segments independently, or exclude recombinant sequences.

## dN/dS Overview

```python
'''
dN/dS (omega, ω) interpretation:
- ω < 1: Purifying (negative) selection - deleterious mutations removed
- ω = 1: Neutral evolution - no selective pressure
- ω > 1: Positive (diversifying) selection - advantageous mutations favored

Most genes: ω << 1 (strong purifying selection)
Immune genes, reproduction: Often show ω > 1 at specific sites
'''
```

### When dN/dS > 1 Does NOT Indicate Positive Selection

| False Signal | Mechanism | Detection |
|---|---|---|
| GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) | Fixes AT->GC mutations regardless of fitness; causes ~20% of apparent positive selection in primates | W->S substitution bias, correlation with recombination rate, subtelomeric enrichment |
| Synonymous site selection | Codon usage bias deflates dS, inflating omega | High codon bias (ENC < 35), highly expressed genes |
| Saturation | Multiple substitutions erase signal when dS >> 1 | dS > 3 unreliable; dS > 1 treat with caution |
| Alignment errors | Misaligned codons create artificial nonsynonymous changes | Inspect alignment at BEB-flagged sites; check GUIDANCE scores |
| Non-allelic gene conversion | Concerted evolution between paralogs creates substitution bursts | Check for copy number variation; exclude recent duplicates |
| Small sample size | Stochastic variation in short genes or closely related species | Need minimum ~8 sequences with sufficient tree depth |

### Recommended Analysis Pipeline

1. **Codon-aware alignment**: PRANK (preferred) or MACSE
2. **Recombination screening**: GARD -- partition if breakpoints found
3. **Gene-level screen**: BUSTED -- any positive selection anywhere in the gene?
4. **Branch-level**: aBSREL -- which lineages show selection? (a priori hypothesis preferred)
5. **Site-level**: MEME for episodic, FEL/FUBAR for pervasive selection
6. **Validate**: Multiple methods agreeing at same sites increases confidence
7. **Multiple testing correction**: FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg) when testing across many genes

## PAML Codeml Analysis

**Goal:** Test for positive selection across a gene using codon-based site models.

**Approach:** Prepare a codon alignment in PHYLIP format, create codeml control files for nested models (M7 vs M8 or M1a vs M2a), run codeml, extract log-likelihoods, perform a likelihood ratio test, and identify positively selected sites from the BEB analysis.

```python

## Branch-Site Models

**Goal:** Test for positive selection on a specific lineage (foreground branch) while allowing variable rates across the tree.

**Approach:** Mark the foreground lineage with #1 in the tree file, create branch-site model A control files for both alternative and null hypotheses, run codeml, and perform an LRT with df=1.

```python
def create_branch_site_control(alignment, tree, foreground_branch, output_dir):
    '''Create control file for branch-site test

    Branch-site model A tests for positive selection on
    specific branches (foreground) while allowing variation
    across the tree.

    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write(tree)

    return output_file
```

## HyPhy Methods

**Goal:** Detect positive selection using HyPhy's suite of methods for gene-wide and site-specific tests.

**Approach:** Follow the recommended pipeline: BUSTED for gene-wide screening, aBSREL for branch identification, MEME/FEL/FUBAR for site-level inference. Each method answers a different question.

### Method Selection Guide

| Method | Question Answered | Significance | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| BUSTED | Any positive selection anywhere in gene? | p <= 0.05 | Initial screening |
| aBSREL | Which branches show selection? | p <= 0.05 (a priori) | Lineage-specific hypotheses |
| MEME | Which sites show episodic selection? | p <= 0.1 | Selection varying across branches |
| FEL | Which sites show pervasive selection? | p <= 0.1 | Constant selection across tree |
| FUBAR | Which sites show pervasive selection? | posterior > 0.9 | Large datasets (faster than FEL) |
| RELAX | Is selection relaxed or intensified? | p <= 0.05 (k<1 relaxed, k>1 intensified) | Comparing selection regimes |

Note: MEME is the ONLY method detecting episodic selection at individual sites. FEL/FUBAR assume constant selection pressure across all branches. RELAX tests selection intensity, NOT positive selection.

```python
def run_hyphy_method(alignment_file, tree_file, method, output_json, foreground=None):
    '''Run HyPhy selection analysis

    Methods: busted, meme, fel, fubar, absrel, relax
    foreground: label foreground branches for BUSTED, aBSREL, RELAX
    '''
    cmd = f'hyphy {method} --alignment {alignment_file} --tree {tree_file} --output {output_json}'

    # For branch-aware methods, specify test branches
    if foreground and method in ('busted', 'absrel', 'relax'):
        cmd += f' --branches {foreground}'

    subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True)
    return output_json


def parse_hyphy_json(json_file):
    '''Parse HyPhy JSON output for p-values and selected sites'''
    import json

    with open(json_file) as f:
        results = json.load(f)

    test_results = results.get('test results', {})
    p_value = test_results.get('p-value')

    # Extract per-site results (MEME/FEL/FUBAR)
    site_results = []
    mle = results.get('MLE', {}).get('content', {})
    headers = results.get('MLE', {}).get('headers', [[]])
    if headers and isinstance(headers[0], list):
        col_names = [h[0] if isinstance(h, list) else h for h in headers[0]]
    else:
        col_names = []

    for key, values in mle.get('0', {}).items():
        if isinstance(values, list):
            site_data = dict(zip(col_names, values)) if col_names else {'values': values}
            site_data['site'] = int(key)
            site_results.append(site_data)

    return {'p_value': p_value, 'LRT': test_results.get('LRT'), 'sites': site_results}
```

## Multiple Testing Correction

When running selection tests across many genes:
- Use FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg) rather than Bonferroni (genes in syntenic blocks are non-independent)
- For PAML branch-site tests across gene families: Holm-Bonferroni or FDR
- For HyPhy aBSREL in exploratory mode (testing all branches): power drops dramatically after correction; prefer a priori hypothesis testing
- HyPhy site-level methods (FEL, MEME) already use conservative thresholds (p <= 0.1); additional correction is typically not applied within a single gene
