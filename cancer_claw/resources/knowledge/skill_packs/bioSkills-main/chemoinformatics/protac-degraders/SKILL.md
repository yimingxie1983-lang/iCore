## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: PRosettaC (web service), DeepTernary 1.0+, AlphaFold3 (constraints-enabled), Boltz-1 / Boltz-2, RDKit 2024.09+, OpenMM 8.1+ (for ternary MD).

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# PROTAC and Bivalent Degrader Design

Design bifunctional molecules (PROTACs) that recruit an E3 ubiquitin ligase to a target protein, inducing target ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. PROTACs differ from traditional drugs: a stable **ternary complex** (target + PROTAC + E3) is required, not just target binding. The PROTAC field exploded post-2020 with clinical successes (ARV-471 estrogen-receptor degrader, ARV-110 androgen-receptor degrader). Postdoc-grade PROTAC design balances **target ligand binding**, **E3 ligand binding**, **linker geometry** (length, rigidity, chemistry), **cooperativity** (positive = ternary stable; negative = hook effect), and **cell permeability** (PROTACs are 800-1500 Da, often Lipinski-violating).

For target ligand design, see `chemoinformatics/virtual-screening` and `chemoinformatics/admet-prediction`. For linker-only enumeration, see `chemoinformatics/reaction-enumeration`. For generative linker design, see `chemoinformatics/generative-design`.

## E3 Ligase Choice

| E3 ligase | Ligand series | Best at | Limitations |
|-----------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| VHL | VL-269 (Salami 2018) | Surface-exposed targets | Tissue-restricted expression |
| CRBN (cereblon) | thalidomide, pomalidomide | Broad tissue expression | Off-target neosubstrates (IKZF1, SALL4) |
| IAP (XIAP, cIAP1) | SMAC mimetics (LCL161, etc.) | Apoptotic / IAP targets | Limited target scope |
| MDM2 | nutlin / idasanutlin | TP53 pathway | Limited target diversity |
| KEAP1 | DDB1-DCAF15-Keap1 | NRF2 pathway | Specialized use |
| RNF114 | EN450 | Newer; under exploration | Limited tooling |
| RNF4 | EN450-RNF4 | Newer; growing | Limited tooling |
| Cyclin E - SKP2 | New ligands emerging | Targeted cancers | Discovery-phase |

**Decision:** For first-generation PROTAC, **CRBN (cereblon)** is the most-developed (thalidomide-derived; broad tissue distribution). **VHL** is second-most-developed (more selective; tissue-restricted). For specialty targets, consider IAP / MDM2.

## Linker Design Principles

Linkers tune ternary complex geometry and stability:

| Property | Range | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Linker length | 8-30 atoms | Critical; geometry-dependent |
| Linker rigidity | Flexible (PEG) vs rigid (piperazine, pyridine) | Higher rigidity often reduces entropy penalty |
| Linker chemistry | PEG, alkyl, piperazine, triazole, ether, amide | PEG common; rigid for tighter binding |
| Click chemistry compatibility | Triazole compatible | Easy synthesis |
| MW range | PROTAC 800-1500 Da | Lipinski-violating but accepted |
| Polar atoms | 1-5 per linker | Permeability vs solubility balance |

**Critical:** The "Goldilocks linker length" is target-specific. Too short = ternary clash; too long = ternary entropy too high. Typically 12-20 atoms for surface-exposed targets.

## Decision Tree by Scenario

| Goal | E3 / linker | Tools |
|------|-------------|-------|
| First-generation PROTAC, surface-exposed target | CRBN + PEG linker (10-15 atoms) | PRosettaC for ternary prediction |
| Selective degrader (avoid off-target) | VHL + rigid linker | PRosettaC + cellular validation |
| BTK / IAP family targets | IAP-based PROTAC | Standard pipelines |
| Targeted protein degradation in cancer | CRBN or VHL | Standard clinical track |
| Novel target, no cryptic | Multiple E3 / linker variants | Combinatorial design + PRosettaC |
| Molecular glue (non-PROTAC) | CRBN-based | Distinct mechanism; pomalidomide-class |
| Optimize cooperativity (alpha > 1) | PRosettaC iterative; experimental | Ternary MD + ITC |
| Cell-active candidate | Standard development | PK + degradation cellular assays |

## Ternary Complex Prediction Tools

| Tool | Approach | Strength | Fails when |
|------|----------|----------|------------|
| PRosettaC | Rosetta + REMD on PROTAC | Mature; reliable | License Rosetta |
| DeepTernary | Equivariant deep learning | Fast; SE(3) | OOD chemistry |
| AlphaFold3 + constraints | Foundation model + restraints | High accuracy | Public access limited |
| Boltz-1 / Boltz-2 + constraints | Foundation model | Fast; flexible | Limited PROTAC training |
| HADDOCK | Restraint-based MD | Veteran | Manual restraint specification |
| Schrodinger Phase + Glide | Commercial | Production-ready | License cost |

**Decision:** For first-pass ternary modeling, **PRosettaC** is the standard. For prospective generative + ranking, **AlphaFold3** with constraints (if access) or **Boltz-1/2** (open). **DeepTernary** is a fast alternative when validated against benchmark.

## Cooperativity (Alpha)

Cooperativity quantifies how the ternary complex stabilizes (or destabilizes) the binary binding:

```
alpha = (Kd_binary,target) / (Kd_ternary,target)
```

- alpha > 1: positive cooperativity (ternary stronger than binary)
- alpha = 1: no cooperativity (independent binding)
- alpha < 1: negative cooperativity (mutual destabilization)

**Positive cooperativity** (alpha > 2-3) is the gold standard for PROTAC design. It means the ternary complex is stabilized by protein-protein interactions induced by the linker geometry.

Measure with ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry) or SPR/BLI titrations of binary vs ternary.

## DC50 / Dmax Characterization

In cellular assays:
- **DC50**: PROTAC concentration for 50% degradation (analogous to IC50)
- **Dmax**: maximum fraction degraded at any concentration

| Property | Good value | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| DC50 | < 100 nM | Clinically meaningful |
| Dmax | > 80% | Sufficient depletion for phenotype |
| Hook effect | < 10x range | Linear dose-response over 100x |
| Hook concentration | typically > 10x DC50 | Above which binary complexes dominate |

**Hook effect**: at high PROTAC concentrations, binary complexes (PROTAC-target alone, PROTAC-E3 alone) dominate, and ternary complex formation drops. Dose-response curves are bell-shaped.

## Ternary Complex Modeling Workflow

**Goal:** Predict 3D structure of target-PROTAC-E3 ternary complex.

**Approach:**
1. Start with binary co-crystals: target + target-ligand pose; E3 + E3-ligand pose
2. Connect via linker enumeration (combinatorial)
3. Score by geometric feasibility (linker length, no clashes)
4. Refine with energy minimization

```python
# Pseudo-code workflow
def predict_ternary(target_pdb, target_ligand_sdf,
                    e3_pdb, e3_ligand_sdf, linker_smiles):
    # 1. Place binary complexes in same coordinate frame
    # 2. Enumerate linker connectivity from target-ligand exit vector to e3-ligand entry vector
    # 3. Score by total linker length, RMSD to expected geometry
    # 4. Minimize with restraint MD (5-20 ns)
    return ternary_poses
```

For production workflow, use PRosettaC web service or AlphaFold3 with chain-chain constraint inputs.

## Linker Length Calculation

```python
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import AllChem

def linker_distance(target_pose, e3_pose, target_ligand_smi, e3_ligand_smi, n_conf=20):
    """
    Compute distance between target-ligand exit vector and e3-ligand entry vector.
    Linker must span this distance with flexibility.
    """
    # Place target + e3 in same frame (from PRosettaC or HADDOCK)
    # Find target-ligand attachment atom and e3-ligand attachment atom
    # Compute distance
    pass

def required_linker_atoms(distance_A, rigidity='flexible'):
    """
    Estimate atoms needed in linker to span distance.
    Flexible (CC bond ~1.5 A) -> distance / 1.5
    Rigid (sp2 C-C ~1.4 A) -> distance / 1.4 + curvature factor
    """
    if rigidity == 'flexible':
        return int(distance_A / 1.4 * 1.2)  # 20% slack
    return int(distance_A / 1.4 * 1.5)
```

## Generative Linker Design

Combine REINVENT 4 linker mode with ternary prediction:

```toml
[run]
type = "linker"
prior_file = "priors/linker.prior"

[parameters]
input_smiles = "[*]NC(=O)..."  # Target ligand with attachment
linker_target_smiles = "[*]NC(=O)..."  # E3 ligand with attachment
n_steps = 200

[scoring_function.components]
type = "linker_length"
weight = 0.3
target_atoms = 14

type = "ternary_score"
weight = 0.5
ternary_predictor = "deepternary"  # API call

type = "qed"
weight = 0.2
```

REINVENT 4 supports linker generation; scoring needs ternary prediction (currently expensive). Modern best practice: combinatorial enumeration with PRosettaC scoring.

## Per-Tool Failure Modes

### PRosettaC -- inaccessible E3 in selected ligase

**Trigger:** Target's known binding mode incompatible with E3 ligase orientation.

**Mechanism:** PRosettaC samples linker conformations; can't bridge if E3 surface is occluded.

**Symptom:** Low ternary complex scores; high RMSD across replicates.

**Fix:** Try different E3 (CRBN vs VHL); use ARV-110 / ARV-471 family templates.

### DeepTernary -- novel chemotype

**Trigger:** Target ligand or E3 ligand outside training distribution.

**Mechanism:** DeepTernary learns from TernaryDB; novel chemotypes extrapolate.

**Symptom:** Predicted ternary complex unrealistic.

**Fix:** Validate against PRosettaC; use as fast screening, validate top-N with PRosettaC.

### Hook effect at low PROTAC concentration

**Trigger:** PROTAC linker too long; binary preferred energetically.

**Mechanism:** Negative cooperativity at low concentration; ternary unstable.

**Symptom:** Dose-response curve narrow; DC50 close to hook.

**Fix:** Shorter linker; increase cooperativity by adding protein-protein contact-promoting motifs.

### Insufficient cell permeability

**Trigger:** PROTAC > 1200 Da, polar, high TPSA.

**Mechanism:** Lipinski violations; permeability bottleneck.

**Symptom:** Cellular DC50 1000x worse than biochemical DC50.

**Fix:** Optimize linker for amphipathic profile; PROTACs often violate Ro5 but successful ones are < 1200 Da with < 130 TPSA.

### E3-target distance miscalculation

**Trigger:** Computing linker length from binary models without ternary refinement.

**Mechanism:** Binary structures don't capture ternary geometry.

**Symptom:** PROTACs synthesized at wrong linker length; no degradation.

**Fix:** Use PRosettaC-refined ternary distance; enumerate ±3 atoms around predicted optimal.

### Molecular glue vs PROTAC confusion

**Trigger:** Designing as PROTAC when target lacks defined ligand.

**Mechanism:** Molecular glues (like thalidomide for IKZF1) don't have target ligand component.

**Symptom:** Design too rigid; no degradation despite ternary prediction.

**Fix:** For targets without known ligand, consider molecular glue discovery instead.

## Reconciliation: PRosettaC vs AlphaFold3 (Constraint-Based)

| Aspect | PRosettaC | AlphaFold3 |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Approach | REMD on linker + binary | Foundation model + restraints |
| Accuracy | High (validated benchmark) | Limited PROTAC data in training |
| Speed | Hours per ternary | Minutes |
| Open access | Yes (web service) | Public API, limited usage |
| Customization | Limited | Constraint flexibility |
| Decision | Standard for PROTAC | Promising; validate |

For PROTAC design, **PRosettaC + ITC/SPR experimental validation** is the current best practice.

## Common Errors

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| PRosettaC fails to converge | Linker too long or E3 surface buried | Try different E3; check binary structure quality |
| DeepTernary returns clashing pose | OOD chemotype | Use PRosettaC for refinement |
| AlphaFold3 ternary unrealistic | Constraint not specified properly | Use chain-chain distance constraints |
| PROTAC cell-active but biochemical degradation poor | Off-target neosubstrate (CRBN-IKZF) | Confirm target specificity via mass spec |
| Hook effect at low PROTAC concentration | Negative cooperativity | Optimize linker geometry |
| Synthesis too complex | Linker via 5+ step | Use click chemistry (triazole linker) |
| MW > 1500 Da issue | Excessive linker | Reduce linker length; rigid linker |
