# proteomics

## Overview

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis from raw data to differential abundance.

**Tool type:** mixed | **Primary tools:** pyOpenMS, limma, DEqMS, QFeatures

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| data-import | Load and parse mass spec data formats (mzML, mzXML, MaxQuant output) |
| peptide-identification | Peptide-spectrum matching and protein identification |
| quantification | Label-free and labeled (TMT/iTRAQ/SILAC) protein quantification |
| proteomics-qc | Quality control, missing value analysis, batch effect detection |
| differential-abundance | Statistical testing with preprocessing, empirical Bayes moderation, and FC shrinkage |
| ptm-analysis | Post-translational modification identification and localization |
| protein-inference | Protein grouping, inference, and FDR control |
| dia-analysis | Data-independent acquisition analysis with DIA-NN |
| spectral-libraries | Build and use spectral libraries (empirical and predicted) |

## Example Prompts

- "Load MaxQuant proteinGroups.txt and filter contaminants"
- "Perform label-free quantification from mzML files"
- "Find differentially abundant proteins between treatment and control"
- "Identify phosphorylation sites from enriched samples"
- "Calculate protein-level FDR using target-decoy approach"

## Requirements

```bash
# Python
pip install pyopenms pandas numpy scipy

# R
install.packages(c("limma", "ashr"))
BiocManager::install(c("DEqMS", "QFeatures", "proDA", "MSnbase"))
```
